You are working on the Meilisearch MCP Server project, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables interaction with Meilisearch through LLM interfaces like Claude.

Key Technologies:
- Python 3.10+
- Meilisearch API (v0.33.0+)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP v0.1.0+)
- HTTPX for HTTP requests
- Pydantic for data validation

Project Goals:
1. Provide a seamless interface between LLMs and Meilisearch
2. Enable comprehensive search functionality across indices
3. Support full Meilisearch feature set including:
   - Index and document management
   - Settings configuration
   - Task monitoring
   - API key management
   - Health monitoring

Development Guidelines:
1. Follow Python best practices and PEP standards
2. Use type hints and Pydantic models for data validation
3. Maintain comprehensive error handling
4. Keep code modular and maintainable
5. Write clear documentation for all features
6. Test thoroughly using pytest
7. Format code using black with line length 88

Remember to:
- Create feature branches for new development
- Update documentation when adding features
- Follow semantic versioning
- Consider backward compatibility
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Log important operations
- Validate all user inputs
